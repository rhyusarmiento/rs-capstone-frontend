# TODO

- Now that you have your app live, go ahead and update your readme with links to the live versions.  I would also link between the two repos, for instance on the backend readme make a link to the front end repo.  I would also give a brief summary of what these repos are used for.  The front end README is just the generic one that comes with npx-create-react-app.
- Mobile friendly.  Need to work on the main page for logging in.
- When submitting forms or anything revolving async code make sure to show spinners or let users know whats happening.
- After searching for a team make it so they can just click on the entire box.
- Browse all teams which will just show all teams
- Find more teams will let you search for teams
- State needs to be a dropdown so the correct data gets sent
- Add a check for the correct phone number before sending.
